Looking into the data inside the packets, we see that the first two packets start with 03000016. I looked this up on GitHub and found some scripts(https://github.com/tijldeneut/ICSSecurityScripts/blob/03cf22205e11629cdee661d87d969176b409abc6/SiemensScan.py#L562).

This lead me down to S7comm(https://wiki.wireshark.org/S7comm) and in the examples(https://wiki.wireshark.org/uploads/__moin_import__/attachments/SampleCaptures/s7comm_reading_setting_plc_time.pcap) section was example time setting traffic.

I compare the raw TCP of the example traffic to the given traffic and only 1 line isnâ€™t similar.

The portion of the example data that was different (00191408201159330400) is a date as parsed in Wiresharks S7comm parsing.

Looking at our file we see 00202309211959299490 which can be parsed to 2023:09:21:19:59:29:949.

SHA256 sum of that gives us our flag.
